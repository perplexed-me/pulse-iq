# Security Fix - Removed Hardcoded Secrets

## Issue
GitHub Push Protection detected hardcoded Google Cloud Service Account credentials in the repository history.

## Files Fixed
1. `user-appointment-service/load-env.ps1` - Removed hardcoded Firebase service account JSON
2. `user-appointment-service/load-env.sh` - Removed hardcoded Firebase service account JSON

## Changes Made
- Replaced hardcoded Firebase credentials with environment variable references
- Updated scripts to load Firebase configuration from:
  1. Environment variable `FIREBASE_JSON` (preferred)
  2. External file `firebase-service-account.json` (fallback)
- Added proper error handling for missing Firebase configuration

## Security Improvements
- No sensitive credentials are now stored in the repository
- Firebase configuration must be provided via GitHub secrets or external files
- Scripts now provide clear feedback about Firebase configuration status

## CI/CD Pipeline Updates
- Updated CI pipeline to use GitHub secrets for all environment variables
- Added payment-service to build and test processes
- Updated CD pipeline to include all 4 services (user-appointment, payment, AI, frontend)
- All sensitive values are now properly managed through GitHub secrets

## Required GitHub Secrets
See `GITHUB-SECRETS.md` for complete list of required secrets.

## Note
This fix required removing the problematic commits from git history to satisfy GitHub Push Protection.
